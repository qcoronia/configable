# Introduction 
**configable** is an angular web app that can be configured from a json file. _(still in development)_

This can be used when you need a simple and basic web app that just works.

Or when you just need a basic crud interface for your backend api.

# Getting Started
- Make sure [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [angular cli](https://cli.angular.io/) are installed
- run `ng s` in the command line for the web app
- run `json-server data/db.json` in the command line for the backend api
- Log in using the sample user:
    - username: sample@user.com
    - password: sample
- You can customize the [config.json](src/assets/config.json) to fit your needs
- You can also mount it in your localhost for easier access anytime

# Software dependencies
- [angular 9](https://angular.io/)
- [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server/)
